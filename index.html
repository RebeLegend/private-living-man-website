        <h2>National Citizenship Status</h2>
        <p>
            I, Richie Richardson, A US National, and a peaceful and non-combative man, have great respect for all people and expect to be treated with the same respect. I live my life minding my own business, never bothering anyone, and always seeking harmony in my interactions. I am not, nor have I ever been, connected to the commercial system, as I live in tune with my soul and spiritual essence. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Material possessions and financial wealth hold no meaning for me, and my focus is on living freely, respecting nature and the land. I seek to live in peace, pursuing ways to sustain myself off the land without interference. My status as a U.S. National affords me the inherent right to travel, exist, and live without the imposition of statutory systems, as I adhere to the laws of the Creator and common law principles.
        </p>
        <p>
            The following legal principles and maxims of law affirm my right to live as a free, private man:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>“No one is bound to expose himself to risk of harm.” — Digest 50.17.203.</li>
            <li>“A man is free to do that which he wills, provided he infringes not the equal freedom of others.” — Sir William Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England, Book 1.</li>
            <li>“It is a presumption of law that no one is bound to accuse himself.” — Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436 (1966).</li>
            <li>“All men are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness.” — Declaration of Independence.</li>
            <li>“The rights of the individual are superior to the needs of the government.” — Hale v. Henkel, 201 U.S. 43 (1906).</li>
            <li>“The right to travel freely is an element of personal liberty, secured by the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.” — Kent v. Dulles, 357 U.S. 116 (1958).</li>
            <li>“Commerce is a commercial activity, not private conduct of a man in his natural state.” — UCC §1-103.</li>

        <h2>Beliefs as a Private Living Man</h2>
        <p>
            As a private living man, I follow the guidance of my spirit and respect the natural laws of the universe. I do not wish to engage in disputes or conflicts with any person or entity. My life is driven by peaceful interactions, non-interference, and mutual respect. I do not seek to challenge the authority or ego of any individuals I encounter. Instead, I operate from a place of peace and goodwill.
        </p>
        <p>
            My beliefs are rooted in the principles of personal freedom, where no man or system may claim ownership or authority over my being without my consent. I choose to live in a way that honors my spiritual path, and I ask that I be left to live according to the natural order.
        </p>

    <section id="commercial" class="section-bg">
        <h2>Commercial Interaction</h2>
        <p>
            Regarding commercial activities, I have never entered into the commercial system nor consented to be governed by it. My existence is spiritual, not materialistic, and I wish to remain separate from all commercial jurisdictions. Any interaction I have with others is under the premise of mutual agreement, respect, and common law.
        </p>
        <p>
            I assert my right to remain free from involuntary servitude or imposed contracts, as affirmed by the following legal principles:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>“No man can be compelled to act as a surety against his will.” — Digest 50.17.43.</li>
            <li>“Where there is no contract, there is no obligation.” — UCC §2-201(3).</li>
            <li>“No one is obligated to accept benefits against his will.” — Maxim of Law.</li>
            <li>“A right cannot be taken from a man without his consent.” — Maxim of Law.</li>
            <li>“The government may not compel a person to work for it without pay.” — United States v. Kozminski, 487 U.S. 931 (1988).</li>
            <li>“No one can serve two masters; for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other.” — Matthew 6:24 (Biblical Maxim).</li>
        </ul>
